VUT - Vim Universal Templates are direct continuation
of VHT Script #988. Difference is you can define comment
strings and use editable or library tags in every type of
file (html, xhtml, css, javascript, cpp, tex, vim, etc.).

When migrating from VHT - 
HAVE TO CHANGE
- change name of core file from *.htmlmain into *.vutmain
- default comment strings are /*, */, script package
  is providing configuration for popular types of files:
	xhtml, html, tex, vim

NOT HAVE TO CHANGE
- extensions of files are still the same (vhl, vht)

Old commands are saved for backwards compatibility but added new set of
commands beginning with VUT or VUL. Note - VH commands may be dropped in
future.

Additional changes:
- VULupdate/VUTupdate can take name of library as an argument. Example:
	:VULupdate panel.vhl
	This will update contents of LibraryItem panel.vhl regardless of cursor
	position. Superuseful in connection with :argdo family. Argument had be
	a full path with .vhl extension.
- added: use ~/Library/ for global library items for VULshow.  
- fixed: VUTcommit.
